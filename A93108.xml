            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THere is a little Piece on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject made by one (as I am informed) That is dead, of which there hath been ſeveral Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb facs="tcp:115766:3"/> And being ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly Intreated to make ſome Additions to it, eſpecially of the <hi>New Lawes</hi> that hath come forth ſince <hi>that time;</hi> The which while I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered thereon, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within my ſelf, That the Labour would not be much more to make a <hi>New Book,</hi> by way of an <hi>Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to all the Larger Volumes: For the

               <head>CHAP. I. Of ſome things neceſſary to be known for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Work.</head>
               <p>FOr the better underſtanding of this whole WORK, we muſt know,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which we ſhall do in this whole Work, is, 1. To ſay a little to the general power of the Juſtices of the Peace. 2. To ſhew what the Juſtices of Peace may do out of the Seſſions of the Peace. 3. What they may do in their Seſſions of the Peace. 4. What they may do, in or out of the Seſſions of the Peace. 5. What they may not do, in or out of the Seſſions of the Peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By that which we ſay may be done by one Juſtice of the Peace, we inteud that it may alſo be done by two or more Juſtices of the Peace. And ſo by that which may be done by two, that it may alſo be done by three or more Juſtices of the Peace.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:115766:6"/>3. Where we ſay, A thing may be done by two or more Juſtices; there it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done by fewer then that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When we ſay, That it is requiſite to the doing of a thing by the Juſtices, that one or two of them that do it, be of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> then it cannot be done by others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Where we ſay, That one or more Juſtices of the Peace may do a thing, we do hereby intend alſo, that he or they ought, and it is his or their duty, to do it. And it may be expected from him or them if it be required; and he or they may in one way or other be blamed for his or their not doing of it. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſay, He is commanded, or ought to to do, or muſt do, or is to do, ſuch a thing; by this we intend alſo, That he may and hath power to do the ſame thing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Where we ſay, One, or two Juſtices may do a thing, and do not adde, (and one of them of the <hi>Quorum),</hi> there we intend, that any Juſtices, whether of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> or not of the <hi>Quorum</hi> may do it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Where we ſay, Juſtices of Peace have power to do a thing; there we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, That not onely the Juſtices of the Peace of Counties, have power to do the <note place="margin">Mayors, Bayliffs, &amp;c.</note> ſame thing within their Counties; but that Mayors, and other Head-Officers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115766:6"/> alſo that are Juſtices of the Peace within Cities, &amp;c. may do the ſame thing within their Cities, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Where we ſay, The Conviction is <note place="margin">Conviction. Confeſſion.</note> to be by the Confeſſion of the party, or by Confeſſion onely; by this we mean, the Confeſſion of the party offending. Where we ſay, It is to be by view; by <note place="margin">View.</note> this we mean the view, or ſight of the Juſtice of the Peace himſelf. Where we ſay, the Conviction muſt be by proof of Witneſſe, we do not intend by this, <note place="margin">Witneſſe.</note> that it muſt be by proof of Witneſſe upon Oath; unleſſe we ſo expreſſe it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Where we ſpeak of a Warrant, <note place="margin">Warrant.</note> that the Juſtice or Juſtices of the Peace may make; and ſay not, what kind of Warrant, or to whom it ſhall be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we do generally intend a Warrant in Writing under the hand and ſeal of the Juſtice or Juſtices of the Peace. And that it be directed to the Conſtable, Tything-man, or other Officer of the place. And where we ſay, That the warrant is to be ſent to the Conſtable, and no more, we do by this generally intend the Conſtable of the place where the offender dwells.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Where we ſpeak of ſale of goods, <note place="margin">Rendring, &amp;c.</note> rendring, &amp;c. and ſay no more, we do by this intend, That the Officer is to prze and ſell the goods Diſtrained, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115766:7"/> to keep up ſo much of the money as the Forfeiture is, and return the overplus to him that did owe the goods.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Where we ſay, Levied by his or <note place="margin">His or Their.</note> their Warrant, we do intend hereby the Warrant of the Juſtice or Juſtices of the Peace.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Where we ſay, The Juſtices <note place="margin">Where &amp;c.</note> where, &amp;c. or the poor where, &amp;c. and no more, we do hereby intend, the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the County, or the poor of the place where the offence is committed. But where we ſay, the Juſtices or the Poor, where or where, &amp;c. by this we <note place="margin">Where or where, &amp;c.</note> do generally intend, that the caſe is ſuch, That the Warrant muſt be penned and directed according to the Act which ſometimes is meant of the Juſtices of the County, and poor of the place where the offender doth live, or is firſt apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ſometimes where the offender doth live, or the offence is done. In this caſe the Statute muſt be looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Where we ſay, That the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture ſhall go to the uſe of the poor, <note place="margin">Poor.</note> &amp;c. and ſay not what poor; we do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally intend the poor of the place where the offence is committed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Where we ſay an offender is to be puniſhed, to be convicted, or the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Before, or In the laſt.</note> levied, or the offender diſabled, &amp;c. <hi>[as before, or as in the laſt];</hi> we do by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115766:7"/> this intend, that the proceeding againſt the offender is in that offence, as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to be done for that offence which went laſt before it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Where we ſet down times of the Kings and Queens; as 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> 27. 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. and times of the year of the Lord; as 6 April, 1654. and the like; By this we mean the Acts and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Parliament ſet forth in thoſe dayes and times, which by ſearch may by this light be found out.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Where the Juſtice doth intend to act any thing upon any one Head, our advice is, that he read it through before he do it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Power of Iuſtices of the Peace in the general.</head>
               <p>AS to this Point, Of the Power of the Juſtices of the Peace in general, theſe things are to be known:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Power that the Juſtices <note place="margin">How deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to them.</note> of the Peace have, is given to them partly by, and from the Commiſſion of the Peace, and therein by the Common Law. And partly, by certain Acts and Ordinances of Parliament. And ſome of it is converſant about Criminal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the reſtraint, and puniſhment of divers offences. Some of it is about other things neceſſary to be done in the Common-wealth, and for the better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the County; as for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Officers, ſettling of Rates, and the like. By their Commiſſion of the Peace, they are authorized to look to the Peace of the County, to puniſh accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law thoſe that break it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and take Surety of the Peace of all ſuch as threaten hurt to others in their bodies, or to burn their houſes, and ſend to Gaol ſuch as refuſe to give Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And to puniſh many offences tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the breach of the Peace. Some
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115766:8"/> offences that are offences by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law, and ſome by the Acts and Ordinances of Parliament. Some of which Acts and Ordinances have made new offences, and have given the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces power to puniſh them. And ſome of theſe alſo give them power to puniſh offences that were offences by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law in a higher degree, or in a greater meaſure than they were puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before by the Common-Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This power is over all perſons <note place="margin">Over whom it is.</note> within the County, Except their Fellow-Juſtices, and the perſons that live in ſuch places within the County, that are exempt, having Juſtices within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This power the Juſtice of Peace may exerciſe and execute, part of it, as <note place="margin">What they may do out of their county.</note> to take Informations againſt offenders, to prove offences done in the County where they are committed, or to take the Oath of a man robbed, whether he know the parties that robbed him or not; or to take a Recogn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AS to theſe Officers, theſe things are to be known in this place:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is ſaid, That any one Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <note place="margin">Election of Him.</note> of Peace, in caſe of neceſſity, in a Hundred or Pariſh, where there is no Conſtable for the Hundred or Pariſh for the preſent, (the Officer being dead, or otherwiſe gone) and the Seſſions is far off, no Leet in the place, or it is far off in the time of keeping of it, much to do for an Officer, and the like; in ſuch Caſes, that one Juſtice alone may make and ſwear a Conſtable for the Hundred, or Pariſh. And we would have this to be Law, if we knew how to make it good, for the neceſſity thereof in many places where otherwiſe this Officer will fail, except it may be ſupplyed by the Country Leet, there being no Leet in the place. But truly we look upon this as a thing ſomewhat dangerous to be done by a Juſtice of Peace out of Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, eſpecially where the Election of the Officer is for a place that hath a Leet, for haply the Election may he void, and the Lord of the Franchiſe may have his Action of the Caſe againſt <note place="margin">Caution to Juſtices,</note> the Juſtice. So alſo if an unfit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115766:20"/> be choſen, that he may after this way (as hath been held and uſed) be removed by the Juſtices in, or out of <note place="margin">Remove of him.</note> Seſſions, and another more fit put in his place. So if there be need of more Conſtables in any Hundred or Pariſh, that the Juſtices out of the Seſſions may make, and ſwear them. This we agree to be generally practiſed, and ſo ſeems now to have the Countenance of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to warrant it. And yet we much doubt of this. And therefore would adviſe rather to have what is done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to be done in the Seſſions onely. See <hi>Steel's</hi> Rep. 362. and Chap. 7. Sect. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe Officers are the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Officers under the Juſtices of the Peace, (as to the matters of the Peace) and to them are their Warrants to be directed, except it be in ſpecial Caſes, where by Acts of Parliament they are to be directed to ſome others.</p>

When any man is ſuſpected of Felony by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that is willing to inform againſt the Felon, the Juſtice may take his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation upon oath (if he will ſo give it). Or he may (if he pleaſe) take it (as we conceive) without Oath. And if the party will not give it upon oath, yet the Juſtice ſhall do well to take it ſo. Nor will we adviſe a Juſtice to force any thing in this caſe; but to take ſuch Information as the Informer will give, and bind him over. 4. If a Felony hath been done, and there are ſome that can diſcover the Felon, and will not voluntarily come in and inform; the Juſtice of Peace may ſend his Warrant to require them to come in to him, and give ſuch Evidence as they can againſt the perſon ſuſpect; and if they be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and refuſe, he may perhaps bind them to the good Behaviour, and to appear at the Seſſions to anſwer their contempt therein. 5. The Juſtice of Peace when the Suſpect-perſon is brought before him, is to examine him, which he is not to do upon Oath. But he may examine others againſt him; and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115766:25"/> this he may do upon Oath, if they will be ſo examined. 6. He muſt put the <note place="margin">Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Examination, or the Effect thereof in writing, and let the perſon examined (if he will) put his hand to it. 7. If the Juſtice ſee any cauſe of ſuſpition in the Caſe, he is to ſend the perſon Suſpect, by a <hi>Mittimus</hi> to the Goal, and bind <note place="margin">Mittimus.</note> over the Informer, if there be any in the Caſe, or if not, ſome other perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted <note place="margin">Bind over.</note> in it, or one that doth appear to proſecute it, or one of the Witneſſes to proſecute the ſuſpected perſon at the next General Goal-delivery or Seſſions (as the caſe is).

                  <p n="4">4. But our Adviſe to the Juſtices of Peace herein is. That they be very <note place="margin">Caveat to the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> cautious what they do out of Seſſions, theſe things upon this Statute, and that they uſe not ſome of my Warrants, as to this, I have given in the <hi>Clarks Cabinet.</hi> See chap. 7. Sect. 6. For there is a Clauſe in it. That every Retainer, and giving of wages, contrary to the true meaning of the Statute ſhall be void. And there are few Retainers according to the Statute. Beſides there is ſome doubt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the power and way of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Offender, or levying of the Forſeiture for the Offence, upon moſt of the branches of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. And yet this perhaps, a Juſtice may adventure to do. If a Labourer be in his preſence, and idle, and diſenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and he refuſe to work in a time of need in the Harveſt, to commit him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statute. And ſuch as have had time ſet them by the Juſtices, wherein to ſet themſelves into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and they do it not, and the parties be before them and conſeſſe it, and are willfull; there the Juſtices may Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt them according to the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115766:52"/> And in caſe of purloyning by Servants from their Maſters, and where the Contumacy, and miſcarriage of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants towards their Maſters is very fowl, there they may adventure, and ſo may one Juſtice (perhaps by the very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law, and of his own diſcretion) to bind him to the good behaviour, and to appear at the Seſſions. And for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that ariſe between Maſters and Servants, and Apprentices, any Juſtice may of his diſcretion labour to ſet them agreed, and by conſent of both parties, order any thing between them. And in ſome Caſes where he ſeeth a ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bind over the party to appear at Seſſions. But other wiſe the ſafe way is to refer theſe matters to, and to have all theſe offenders puniſhed at the Quarter-Seſſions. For we do not perceive that it can well be done any where elſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Every Juſtice not hindered by Sickneſſe, or other good cauſe, is to be preſent at the Taxing of wages, under pain of 10 l. by <hi>5 Eliz. 4. 1. Iac. 6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. As to a Clothier, or other, that <note place="margin">Clothiers for wages.</note> refuſeth to pay to his Workmen the wages ſet down by the Juſtices at the Seſſions. In this caſe, two Juſtices of the Peace (one of them of the <hi>Quorum)</hi> may upon the Conſeſſion of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf, or the proof thereof, [but doth not ſay, upon oath] of two lawfull

If any Servant or Apprentice ſhall imbeſill or ſteal away the goods of his Maſter, any one Juſtice of Peace, if by circumſtances the caſe comes to a plain Felony, may deal with him, as he doth with other men in caſes of Felony, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the caſe.

But this we conceive alſo muſt be done by the Juſtices within, and may not be done by any of the Juſtices out of their Seſſions: And that if the Juſtices will do any thing againſt ſuch perſons out of the Seſſions, it is more ſafe to do it by binding of them to the <note place="margin">Good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</note> good Behaviour.</p>

                  <p>AS to the Warrants the Juſtices of Peace are to make, theſe things are to he heeded:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:115766:79"/>1. It is ſafe for the Juſtice to make all his Warrants in writing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſee they be perfectly done when the Juſtice doth Subſcribe them. And not to leave them with blanks, to be filled up afterwards by others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In all caſes his hand muſt be ſubſcribed; and in ſome caſes his Seal is neceſſary. And therefore it is beſt in all caſes to put his hand, and affix his ſeal to it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the manner of penning it; He may (if he will) put the ſtyle of it in the Lord Protector's Name, thus; <hi>Glouc.</hi> ff. <hi>Oliver,</hi> Lord, &amp;c. Or he may ſend it in his own Name, <hi>A. B.</hi> Eſquire, one of the Juſtices, &amp;c. Or without any ſtyle at all (thus); Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint being made to me, &amp;c. Theſe are to require you, &amp;c. And it may be with, or without, a <hi>Teſle.</hi> But it is <note place="margin">Teſte,</note> not amiſſe to ſay, <hi>Witneſſe my hand and ſeal,</hi> &amp;c. And a certain Date of the <note place="margin">Date,</note> day, moneth, and year, may not be omitted. See in the <hi>Clerks Cabinet,</hi> and in the 30th Chapter of my firſt Book of the Juſtice of Peace his Office, more of this.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Juſtice is to take care hi Warrant be penned plainly and clear
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115766:80"/> ly, that the Officer that is to execute it, may underſtand, and to declare am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous words in it.

And therefore to ſay rather, <hi>That you warn or ſummon bin to come, or be, before me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the Warrant be to be grounded on a Statute-Law, the more care muſt be had in it, exactly to pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. If a Warrant be made by a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to apprehend a man, and bring him before this, or ſome other Juſtice of the Peace, it is ſafe to ſet down in the Warrant the cauſe of it, as that it is to put in Sureties of the Peace, or for the good Behaviour, or becauſe he is charged with a Felony, or the like, And to be ſure, the cauſe will bear ſuch a Warrant. And therefore we cannot approve (at any hand) the uſual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to attach or apprehend men, and bring them before a Juſtice of Peace; and ſay no more, but for miſdemeanor onely; or to anſwer to ſuch matters as ſhall be objected againſt him.

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Order of the proceeding by the Iuſtices of the Peace, in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of offenders within and without the Seſsions of the Peace.</head>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 1.</head>
                  <p>THe Order and manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt offenders for the puniſhment of the offences we have ſpoken of, is either within, or without the Seſſions. The Courſe of the Juſtices of the Peace in the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is to enquire by Jury, and to take their Preſentment, or to receive Indictments, and (in ſome caſes) Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations preferred by others. And thereupon to grant out proceſs againſt the offenders, to come in and anſwer the matter whereof they are accuſed. And upon theie appearance, if they do not conſeſſe the offence, to take and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Traverſe, charge a Jury with the matter of Fact. And if the Jury find them guilty thereof, the Juſtices do give Judgment (as the caſe deſerves) of Fine, Impriſonment, or Amercement, or otherwiſe; And Execution is done
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115766:92"/> thereupon accordingly. And ſo an offender there becomes attaint or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict of his offence, either by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, when he is to plead to it upon the Indictment, Preſentment, or Information; or when upon his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to it, the ſame is referred to a Jury, to try whether he Be guilty or not, And the Jury doth find him Guilty. And this is the common way of Tryall. But there are in ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial caſes, other wayes of Tryall there, by Certificate, Examination of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders and witneſſes; but this is very rarely uſed. The Statute-Lawes, Acts and Ordinances of Parliament where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Juſtices of the Peace have to do, are many; And thoſe (eſpecially as to the point of Conviction of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the execution thereupon) they are variouſly penned; Not three of threeſcore of them do agree therein, but are of ſeverall forms of drawing in that part.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. As to the perſons that are to do the work, Some of them ſay, That the Juſtices of the Peace of the County may do it. Some, That all the Juſtices may do it. Some, That any of the Juſtices may do it. Some, That any one of the Juſtices may do it. Some direct, That the thing muſt be done by one, ſome by two, ſome by more Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices. And ſome, That one of them that do it muſt be of the <hi>Quorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:115766:93"/>
                  <p>2. As to the place where they are to do it. Some of the Lawes ſay, That it ſhall be done by the Juſtices, and do not ſay where is ſhall be done. Others ſay, It ſhall be done in the Quarter-Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Others, in the General Seſſions. Others, in the open Seſſions, or in the publike Seſſions. Others, in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or Quarter-Seſſions, Others, in the ordinary Seſſions. Others, at the uſual and General Seſſions. And others ſay, in the Seſſions. Others, in any Seſſions of the Peace, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. As to the words by which the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices are empowered; Some Statutes, &amp;c. give to the Juſtices power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by theſe expreſſe words, That they ſhall have power. Others are, That they ſhall do it. Others, That they may do it. Others, That it may be done before or by them. Others thus, Such a thing to be done by the Juſtices of the Peace, and the like.</p>
                  <p>4. So for the manner of the doing of it: 1. For the Conviction of the offender of his offence; Some Statutes, &amp;c. ſet down a penalty, and ſay, That the Juſtices ſhall hear and end it; and do not ſay, how. Others ſay, That the Conviction ſhall be by the Oath of witneſſes; ſome, by one; ſome by more witneſſes. Some, by the hearing, view or ſight of Juſtice of Peace. Some, by the Conſeſſion of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Some, by the proof (not ſaying,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115766:93"/> upon Oath) of Witneſſe, or Witneſſes. Some, by Information. Some, by Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: And ſome, by Certificate. Some, by any one; ſome, by two or three of theſe wayes. And ſome give power to adminiſter the Oath; and ſome give no power to adminiſter the Oath. 2. And ſo for Execution; Some direct ſomewhat to be done, and ſay not who ſhall do it. Some of them direct the Juſtice of Peace to make a Warrant, and ſay not what Warrant; whether in writing, or under hand or ſeal; or to whom it ſhall be directed. Some are appointed to be ſent to the Conſtables; ſome, to the Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: ſome, to Overſeers of the Poor; and ſome, to two ſorts of them. Some appoint the Warrant to be in writing, and under the hand and ſeal of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Peace.</p>
                  <p>5. And ſo for the matter or thing to be done; Some to hear and determine in the offence; ſome, to puniſh the offender: ſome are to put the Statute in execution. Others, to puniſh offenders againſt that Law. Some give a power to commit the offender to the Goal; ſome, to the Bride-well; ſome, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain his goods, &amp;c. Some are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict the offender, and then to proceed to execution. Others are, That the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices ſhall convict the offender, and then certifie this Conviction to ſome other Court, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:115766:94"/>
                  <p>We ſhall lay down divers examples of theſe things. And then give our opinion upon them, by way of <hi>Queſtion</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="1">1. Some of the Statutes, &amp;c. we ſpeak of ſeem to give to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace a power to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing onely, or cheifly in the Seſſions of the Peace. And ſome again ſeem to give them a power to do ſomewhat with out the Seſſions of the Peace.
